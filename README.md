# Danmission

### About:
This project was developed as part of our 3rd semester project. We developed a custom inventory management system, for a Danmission charity store (thrift store). We custom developed this, to fit the staffs workflow and work methods, and is therefore not likely to be applicable elsewhere.

The accompanying project report is also prodvided here, as a PDF.

### How to use:
Open in Visual Studio (2015), and build. Next, setup a MySQL server. You should be able to auto-setup a configuration from the classes in <i>..\DBTypes</i> folder, using ADO.NET. (These classes were originally auto generated this way).

### Requirements:
* EntityFramework
* WPF Toolkit
* WPF Toolkit Extended
* MySQL .NET Connector
* A MySQL database (remote or local)
